	<p class='contentWritten'>We are good people trying to do good things. Duh. I mean. Yaw. This stuff rocks yaw.
		I'm trying to put the power back in the hands of the people, and I know that you are very capable of doing some 
		really wonderful and interesting things. As my skills, time, and dedication to this place grow, you will see it flourish
		into things that are not only more functional, but also more elegant and beautiful. I get that it is pretty crusty looking right now, but 
		that is a current work in progress.

	<p class='contentWritten'>
		I am always very open to new suggestions as well. Be cool and leave those here and I will work on some of them as they are 
		interesting for me to learn about and for you to use!
