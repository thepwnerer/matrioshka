		This is the home of the switch teens of Friends Church. I wanted to have something prettier for you guys to use, as it's no fun to go on a site and not only have it unable to do anything, but to be unpretty. No fun at all! As my skills grow so will this place. I want this place to be like any space that I highly appreciate and want to spend time in, and I want you guys to enjoy being here ans much as I enjoy making it (which honestly, can be a bit of a pain in the arse sometimes, but that's the process of learning for you!).

		Leave suggestions. Post questions. Check out some pictures. I believe you guys have the power of the world at your hands and I want you to recognize and use that...

		This place was built off of the belief that I have for each and every one of you to change our world. Let's get busy!
